            <h2>About Intentional Consumption Resort</h2>
                <p>Here our goal is to help you realize the true power of your mind. We aim to educate our guests on the 
                importance of consumption whether that be consumption through eating habits, media intake, economically, and energetically.
                We offer a series of courses over a 5 day period. Each day is dedicated to the different types of consumption. 
                This is not a time to judge. This is a time to reflect. We hope to help you realize how important it is to live a life YOU are proud of. 
                We believe being intentional in each and every moment is a life well spent. The time you have should fulfill you.</p>

                    It is important to think about what you are using to fuel your body. Obesity rates specifically in the US are on the rise. 
                    It’s estimated that over half the caloric intake of the average American diet consist of ultra processed foods.
                    The health effects include increased risk of cancer, death, heart disease, and addiction, to name a few. 
                    Processed food digest quicker and this is why many eat it in excess.
                    It is very easy to sit down and eat mindlessly when distracted by TV or your phone. 
                    Not many people are aware processed foods can have an effect on your mental health as well including decreased brain function and 
                    worsening mood disorders, such as depression.

                    “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” – Jim Rohn. Sometimes we may keep relationships of any kind not because they are beneficial to us
                    but because they are familiar to us. No one is going to be perfect but we all should be striving to be better people everyday. 
                    Being mindful of the thoughts, habits, and company you keep is the first step in becoming a better person. 
                    Every relationship you have, including the one with yourself should be bringing more joy than sorrow in your life.

                    The things we buy are just things. It is okay to splurge on things that you like but it's important to realize that many of the things
                    you buy will not bring you true happiness. As you become more intentional with the things that occupy your space you realize less is more. 
                    Often, true happiness is found in experiences, peacefulness, and the love (internal or external) in our lives. At the end of the day we all want to 
                    live a life with purpose and peace. In life the things that we remember the most are the people and moments not the things.

                    It is so easy to get on our phones and completely lose track of time. Not only do we lose our time but we lose track of our conversations. 
                    It severly hinders the act of appreciating the present moment.  Most tangible things you can get back but lost time is gone forever. We are constantly focused on what we need to do next, who is doing what, and
                    what to buy next. This is very accurately demonstrated in the documentary The Social Dilemma on Netflix. (We highly suggest watching this.)

                    There are endless benefits to getting outside and moving your body in general. 
                    Vitamin D is actually important for our bone and immune health as a humans. Sunlight is also believed to keep you serotonin levels up. 
                    It has been said that even having plants in the home, or even looking at a picture of nature can calm our anxiety and make us feel less stressed.
                    Moving your body and increasing your heart rate or meditating is known to release endorphins. Serotonin and Endorphins are classified as happy hormones.
                    If your goal is to become happier in life, increasing the production of these hormones is a great start!
