                <h3>Will there be time to relax or is this resort a constant workshop?</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course there will be time to relax. In fact, we insist you relax and understand the things we should really be grateful for. 
                    It is hard to slow down, breathe, and be in the present moment in modern day. We want to help build a mindset that prioritizes relaxation, 
                    and being present in any moment."Where you going in such a hurry. Don't you think it's time you realized. There's a whole lot more to life than work and worry
